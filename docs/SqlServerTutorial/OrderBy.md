# SQL Server ORDER BY

We show the most complex examples, which "include" the simplest ones.

### D) Sort a result set by multiple columns and different orders

We return all columns as usually done in EF, though can retrieve some - as done in [SELECT - (A)](Select.md).

### F) Sort a result set by an expression

XLinq maps `String`'s `Length()` function to TSQL's `LEN`.
