# Tuples create light-weight data structures
Tuples are lightweight data structures that contain multiple fields to represent the data members. The fields are not validated, and you cannot define your own methods.

> NOTE:
> Tuples were available before C# 7.0, but they were inefficient and had no language support. This meant that tuple elements could only be referenced as `Item1`, `Item2` and so on. C# 7.0 introduces language support for tuples, which enables semantic names for the fields of a tuple using new more efficient tuple types.

You can create a tuple by assigning a value to each named member:
