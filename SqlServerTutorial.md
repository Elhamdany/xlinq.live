# SQL Server Tutorial

XLinq allows you to use C# (or your .NET language of choice) to write strongly typed queries. It is capable to represent _**any**_ practical SQL [DML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language).

To demonstrate XLinq capabilities we took examples from a popular [SQL Server Tutorial](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/) and implemented them in C# and XLinq in a strongly typed way. Our goal is to show "pixel-perfect" SQL translation, EF integration, type safety and ease of use (we take the example as is, without trying to improve SQL).

This site is built with a wonderful Try .NET technology. All the examples are interactive, intellisense enabled and runnable with changes you may make. Enjoy!
